## Hi there üëã

My name is Jonathan and I'm the co-founder of [crowd.dev](https://github.com/CrowdDotDev/crowd.dev) - the open-source platform to centralize community, product, and customer data for DevTool companies. We help 100s of open-source projects and companies - including the Linux Foundation, OpenBB, Qdrant, etc. - to manage their community and build a meanigful business out of it.

We're also maintaining: 
- [opensourcealternative.to](https://www.opensourcealternative.to/) where already 1m+ people researched open-source alternatives
- [analyzemyrepo.com](https://analyzemyrepo.com/) where you can analyze any GitHub repository
- [ossjobs.dev](https://www.ossjobs.dev/) where you can find awesome jobs in OSS startups
- [awesome OSS investors](https://github.com/CrowdDotDev/awesome-oss-investors) where you can find VCs actively investing in OSS startups
